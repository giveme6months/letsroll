I'm not your average guy I guess.  I really thought I had done a good thing in WA.  But my son and I have paid a big price. I am a paradox yeah, but i got a good heart and this last year has dimmed my flame. Lately some of the reading material left for me has been cruel and malicious and anything but the mission statement. Uod@die.cnt is a prime example.  Anyway I think whoever dropped the ball today was just fully deserving of the fool now shocked and shamed. Thats poetry.  I have ptsd and I can't help but wonder how others would cope in a role reversal situation. For trying to help and thinking the case had a very unorthodox aspect compared to most generic Aus crime. If you understand asperges then you will comprehend the tenacity we profer in any interest. Be it taking stuff apart or working out murders we usually work things out. I have clearly shown the capacity and ability to have done so. What bemuses me is the amount of time taken by experts to rule me out. Putting that much pressure on someone with a stress disorder is a very dangerous venture and today I did lose it.  I think on my feet and use any method at hand to shake something loose and I think most would be stunned at the amount of evidence I have uncovered and secured.  If the hate is from getting caught out at  most turns then too bad.  You have hurt my child and acted far from professional.  I expect Mick Kealty himself to come and apologize to my son.  Nothing at this point will help the situation as even my death so often wanted apparently would only leave those involved looking more inept and outright witless as there is a dead mans trigger in place and the evidence already hidden in others hands.  There is no dark way out. You have never been covert but outright overt and blinding. I would suggest you take away the pressure and just own the mistakes made. I'm wanting a balanced and easy resolution to this rubbish. I am flattered that my mind has brought in experts from around the world like Ian Hickson. l offered transcripts, just reverse engineer my projection, c ,b ,a. I should be auditing the surveillance side and would even offer techniques in the investagative area. Kinisic analysis, surely i would show recognition when evidence has been placed on My monitor... Maybe talk to me.  Whatever the latest and greatest is.  I have no doubt I am correct and solved those crimes but can safely say I had absolutely no prior knowledge other than what my sister told me upon inspection. I have never taken a life nor any soul crime that would leave me worried about passing over. Those being cruel and hurting my boy etc should worry in that regard though.
